\lstset{language=NoBeardAsm}
\section{Overview}
This chapter describes how to use the graphical user interface of the NoBeard virtual machine and serves at the same time as a user manual.
With the NoBeard Machine users are able to load and run NoBeard object files with just a view clicks. The integrated debugger of the virtual machine gives them also the possibility to debug these programs by setting breakpoints \bau{and stepping through the program in one by one assembler instructions}. Another big feature is the data visualization which gives users a whole view of the data memory.
\section{The UI Components}
As shown in figure~\ref{fig:components} the NoBeardMachine contains the following five windows:

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Control Window: }A window with a set of buttons for user interactions.
\item \textbf{Output Window: }A terminal showing outputs of programs and user inputs.
\item \textbf{Program Window: }Shows the actually opened program and its running flow.
\item \textbf{Data Memory Window: }A visualized call stack of a debugged program.
\item \textbf{Input Window: }A single-line field for user inputs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control Window}
This window consists of five buttons that gives the possibility to open, run, step, stop or jump \bau{what do you mean by jump?} in programs. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Open file: }Opens a file chooser dialog where the target object file can be selected.
\item \textbf{Run: }Executes the program from the first byte. \bau{What do you mean by this exactly?}
\item \textbf{Step: }Gives the opportunity \bau{Allows the user} to step one single \bau{assembler instruction} line further in the program flow. This button is only \bau{enabled if the machine is in state \lstinline$blocked$.} in a \lstinline$blocked$ state available.
\item \textbf{Continue: }When the program execution gets interrupted by a breakpoint this button enables users to \bau{continue the execution of the program until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.} jump to the next breakpoint. If there is no breakpoints left it continues the process until the end.
\item \textbf{Stop: }Stops the execution and sets the machine into the \lstinline$stopped$ state.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Output Window}
\bau{The output window} It is a non-editable TextArea \bau{text area} which simulates a terminal. Program outputs that are coming from an \bau{a NoBeard} \lstinline$out$ instruction are shown here. Submitted inputs are also visible here after a successful submit.
\subsection{Program Window}
\bau{The program window shows the assembler instructions of the loaded program with the corresponding start address of each instruction. When clicking on the empty area in front of the instruction's address a breakpoint can be set or unset.} This window shows assembler instructions with the belonging addresses in a VBox. Every line also gets a checkbox that is responsible for setting and removing breakpoints.
\subsection{Data Memory Window}
A ListView filled with raw data from the data memory. Every line of the ListView contains four byte data with the belonging addresses. \bau{The raw data can be converted into different formats like characters or integers to make it better readable to humans. Furthermore the frame pointer and the stack pointer of the currently running frame are highlighted. } Each byte can be converted to a character. Even a whole line can be translated to four characters or to a single four byte integer. Data with blue background color highlights the frame pointer. Red background color stands for the stack pointer.
\subsection{Input Window}
The Input window is a TextField where inputs from users can be handled. It is only enabled when the machine is executing an \lstinline$in$ instruction. To submit an input, the "ENTER" key has to be pressed and then the entered text will be attached to the Output window.

\section{Loading and Running a Program}
After starting the NoBeardMachine, a NoBeard object file has to be loaded by a click on the “Open File” button. Than a file chooser dialog appears where the user can choose the desired file. Afterward the window shows the assembler code and the title of the opened program which is now \bau{ready for execution.} executable.

The Program window lists the assembler instructions with the belonging addresses and operators. \bau{The addresses of the program memory are given in decimal form?} By hitting the “Run” button, the machine executes the loaded program. Output results can be seen in the Output window. If the program runs against an input instruction, the machine stops and requests the user for an input which can be done at the Input window. To submit an input, the Enter key has to be pressed. \bau{After the user pressed the Enter key the program continues its execution.}

\end{figure}

\section{Debugging}
To debug a program the user has to set breakpoints which interrupts the program flow and allows the user to inspect the current state of the running program. These breakpoints can be placed by clicking on the address \bau{or onto the empty space in front of the address??} with the instruction where the program flow has to be interrupted. 

After an interruption \bau{caused by} of a breakpoint, the user is able to step one line further or \bau{continue execution until} jump to the next breakpoint. Stepping is handled by the “Step” button as shown in figure~\ref{fig:debugging}. By clicking the “Continue” button, the program runs from the current line until the next breakpoint. If there is not any breakpoint left from the current line, it runs until the end of the program. Optionally, the user is able to stop the program during the execution. This could be achieved by clicking the “Stop” button.

	\label{fig:debugging}
\end{figure}

\section{Data Visualization}
On the right side of the window is the visualisation of the data memory in a ListView form. This window lists data byte-wise from the data memory of the machine. Each line of the ListView has a content of an address given in decimal notation \bau{followed} following by four bytes \bau{of} raw data. The memory is separated in two parts. The list starts on the top with the string constants followed by stack frames of the currently running functions. While the frame pointer is highlighted with a blue background, the stack pointer is signed with a red background. The user has also the possibility to convert raw data to characters or integers.
With a right click on the selected line of the list, a context menu \baust{could be opened}{opens}. This menu includes following functions:
\bau{This itemize list does not really help in improving the understanding. What I see is that you did some further explanation in the following subsections. Unfortunately the structure there is not coincident with the one of this itemize list. Please bring this into congruence and refer from here to the following sections. Something like: The context menu includes the following functions which will be described in the sections thereafter}
\begin{itemize}
\item showing integer,
\item characters of the whole line, 
\item a single character 
\item or converting back the line to raw data. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.60]{images/screenshot-3.png}
	\caption{Converting data to a character}
	\label{fig:convertToChar}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Converting Data to Character}
To view a character of a one-byte data as shown in figure~\ref{fig:convertToChar}, the following steps \baust{has}{have} to be done:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the line where the one-byte value is located 
\item Right click on the value to be converted
\item Click on "View Char" \bau{The menu entry should be changed to ``View as Char''}
\end{enumerate}
Now the value at the given address is translated to an alphanumeric character. 
\subsection{Converting Data to Integer}
The translation of an integer takes four bytes that means, it takes all values of a whole row and translates them to a single integer.  
\begin{figure}[h] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.85]{images/screenshot-4.png}
	\caption{Converting data to a single integer}
	\label{fig:convertToInt}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the row with the four-byte value 
\item Right click on the line
\item Click on "View Integer"
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{fig:convertToInt} shows an example of a translated integer which is on the same place as the stack pointer, precisely at the address 64. A detailed description of the implementation can be found in chapter~\ref{sec:implementationOfDataVisualisation}. \bau{I am not very convinced to have references to the implementation part of your thesis from here. Think of this chapter to be a stand-alone document which can be read by someone who only wants to use the NbmGui}

\bau{Something I am missing is the problem to get a number of four bytes converted to an integer which are not aligned in one row. Say, you want to convert the four bytes from address 58 to 63 into an int. How to do that?}
\subsection{Multiple Conversion}
\bau{To facilitate the conversion from raw data to alphanumeric characters or integers a multi selection function \ldots} To make the conversion from raw data to alphanumeric characters or integers more easy and fast, a multi selection function is available for the list of the data memory.
To convert multiple data rows, the user has to hold the "Ctrl" key and select the specified rows with \baust{the}{a} left mouse click. Chosen lines will get highlighted with a light grey background color. As figure~\ref{fig:multipleConversion} shows, the selected rows with grey background are successfully concerted to some characters.
